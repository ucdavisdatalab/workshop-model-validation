# Working examples


## Import data
Let's import the data for our examples. 


### COVID-19 admissions

Import the data about COVID-19 admissions:

```{r import-covid}
# import uses the readr package
library( "readr" )

# import the covid data
covid = read_csv( "data/covid.csv" )
```




### Import survival data

The survival data comes from the German Breast Cancer Study Group, so we will call it the `gbsg` data set. After importing the data, we need to re-code the time-to-recurrence + censoring variables to a 0-1 binary variable that encodes five-year recurrence-free survival.

```{r import-gbsg}
# read in the gbsg data
gbsg = read_csv( "data/gbsg.csv" )

# have we observed five years of recurrence-free survival?
gbsg$fys = with(gbsg, ifelse( rfstime > 365*5, 1, ifelse(status == 0, NA, 0)))
```
