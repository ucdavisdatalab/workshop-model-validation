### Description
In this workshop, you will learn the basics of creating a predictive model for health data. We will demonstrate categorical prediction with logistic regression and numerical predictions with a regression tree approach. We will calculate measurements of accuracy that are applicable to the different types of models, and use cross-validation to find the model parameters that generate the best predictions. Finally, we will interpret the results for insights about the real-world process being modeled.

### Excerpt
At this interactive, hands-on workshop, we will create and assess machine learning models for health data.

### Learning Objectives
- Select features for a predictive model
- Fit a logistic regression model
- Fit a regression tree model
- Use cross-validation to tune model parameters
- Estimate the accuracy of predictions for future data
- Interpret model parameters

### Prerequisites
Prior experience with R required in order to full participate in this interactive, hands-on workshop.
